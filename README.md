# ServiceRefactoring

Refactor the ‘AddCustomer’ method in the CustomerService class in order to make the class easier to maintain.
During the refactoring process the SOLID principles considered, how readable the code is and where unit tests might be appropriate.
Any test frameworks can be used. Attempt some refactoring and unit testing to demonstrate your skills in both.
The validation logic isn't perfect but it is not expected to be fixed or make it more comprehensive.
Anything can be changed (method signatures, constructors etc.) apart from making the CustomerDataAccess class and it methods non static.
